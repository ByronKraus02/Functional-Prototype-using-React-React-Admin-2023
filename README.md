# Development and Implementation of a Student Accommodation Management System

#### Introduction

In 2023, as part of our SI/ISM 354 course, my team and I undertook a significant group project involving the design and development of an information system for StelStay Properties. StelStay, a fictional entity, required a comprehensive solution to manage student accommodation in the picturesque town of Stellenbosch. This project challenged us to create a functional and novel system using JavaScript, React, and React-admin, with additional requirements to model data, implement features, and present our solution effectively.

#### Project Overview

**Objective and Scope**

The primary objective of the project was to design and develop an information system that could handle various aspects of managing student accommodation. The system needed to support the application process for leases, manage buildings and apartments, and include at least one additional module from a given list of functionalities. The project scope was carefully defined to focus on creating a functional prototype rather than a fully-fledged system, acknowledging the tight timeline and limited resources.

**Group Formation and Methodology**

Our group consisted of four students, each bringing unique skills to the project. We selected an Agile software development methodology to ensure flexibility and iterative progress. This approach allowed us to adapt to changes and refine our system based on ongoing feedback and testing. We utilized Scrum for organizing our tasks, with regular sprints and stand-up meetings to track our progress and address any challenges.

#### System Design and Development

**Data Modeling**

To begin, we designed a UML class diagram to model the data requirements of our system. This diagram helped us visualize the relationships between different entities, such as students, leases, buildings, and apartments. We also created an Entity-Relationship Diagram (ERD) to further define the data structure and ensure consistency in our database design.

**System Features and Implementation**

1. **Student Application Management**

   The core functionality of our system was to manage student applications for leases. Students could submit their personal information, including name, ID number, contact details, and program of study. The application process did not involve assigning applications to specific apartments initially. Instead, administrators could review applications, add buildings and apartments to the system, and then approve or reject applications. Approved students were assigned to available rooms, streamlining the lease management process.

2. **Additional Modules**

   We implemented the following additional module to enhance our system:
   - **Communication with Residents**: This feature allowed administrators to send messages and notifications to residents, keeping them informed about important updates and events.
   
   We also considered the feasibility of other modules such as event management and parking bay management but chose to focus on delivering a robust core system within the project timeline.

**Technologies Used**

We built our prototype using JavaScript with the React and React-admin frameworks for the front-end. React provided a dynamic and responsive user interface, while React-admin facilitated the creation of an administrative dashboard for managing applications and system data. For the backend, we selected Node.js and Express to handle server-side operations and database interactions.

#### Documentation and Presentation

**Design Documentation**

Our final submission included a detailed PDF document containing our UML class diagrams, ERD, and other design documentation. This document provided a comprehensive overview of our system architecture and data modeling, ensuring clarity and coherence in our design approach.

**Project Presentation**

We prepared for our presentation by including demonstration data to showcase the functionality of our system effectively. During the presentation sessions, we demonstrated how students could apply for leases, how administrators could manage applications, and how the communication module operated. We received feedback and made slight adjustments to our application before the final submission.

#### Reflection and Peer Assessment

**Individual Contributions**

Throughout the project, each team member contributed to different aspects of the system's development, from coding and testing to documentation and presentation. We conducted peer evaluations to ensure equal participation and address any issues of workload distribution. The peer assessment process helped us maintain a fair allocation of tasks and encouraged collaboration.

**Challenges and Lessons Learned**

One of the main challenges was managing the project's scope within the limited timeframe. We learned the importance of prioritizing core functionalities and implementing additional features only if time allowed. Effective communication and regular progress reviews were crucial in overcoming obstacles and ensuring a successful outcome.

#### Conclusion

The SI/ISM 354 group project provided a valuable learning experience in designing and developing an information system. By applying Agile methodology, utilizing modern technologies, and focusing on core functionalities, our team successfully created a functional prototype for StelStay Properties. This project not only enhanced our technical skills but also demonstrated the importance of teamwork, documentation, and effective presentation in software development.
